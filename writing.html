                <b><i>This World Still Knows Nothing</i></b> (WIP) – novel, adult, space opera
                <br>
                A university student studying astrophysics, Jeonghwa has always wanted to make discoveries on the frontier, where 
                researchers study the unknown. When she discovers her research mentor murdered, she starts to wonder what was so 
                dangerous about his own existence. Jeonghwa soon meets Sol, another professor at her school who seems to know more about 
                the ordeal than they reveal. They tell her that her mentor knew something he shouldn't have—and that an organization 
                tried to keep him quiet. But what did he know? 
            </p>
            <p>
                Jeonghwa desperately wants to find out, even if it puts her in danger. She and Sol begin a journey to find 
                the people who killed him and why. Along with them is Kadir, a trained pilot and son of an empress. Motivated by duty 
                and the mundanity of his own life, he escapes his home planet in search of something that might help his family and people. 
                Together, the three jump through wormholes, visiting planets across the colonized universe in order to reach the 
                mysterious frontier—where there is said to be a discovery so dangerous it must be kept secret at all costs.
